HW 5: Help log by Dan McCann

Q: Question	A: Answer	

Q: Why is it so annoying to get the start point of an edge?
A: It isn't, e.sym.vert gets it if sym exists. -- Remi

Q: How do you approach constructing the buffers from half edge traversal?
A: Look at the instructions. It's done by face. -- Remi

Q: Why are the edges rainbow?
A: Use the vertex color buffers for your drawable. -- Adam

Q: How do you remove something from a vector?
A: erase(vec.start() + i) where i is the index of the element to be removed. -- Stack Overflow.

Q: How do you remove only one pointer from a vector without deleting it?
A: Don't try. Find another container or a workaround. -- Stack Overflow, Google

B: Bug / Difficulty	R: Resolution

B: Making the cube creates a bad_alloc
R: Resolved. Found an incorrect edge->next pointer in the cube. A while loop never finished and it ran out of memory.

B: One corner of the cube has a gradient
R: Resolved. Checked pointers and found an incorrect edge traversal.

B: Trying to redraw the cube causes a GL_Invalid_Operation
R: Resolved. Call update() in MyGL instead of the repaint function.

B: Segmentation fault when calling the edge split function
R: Resolved. When updating the QListWidgets, clear() or erase DELETES all elements, does not remove them. 
	They must be removed one by one and added again.

B: Crash soon after edge split when OpenGL complains about timers.
R: Resolved. Passed something of the wrong type into a buffer related function.

B: Seg fault on debugger only (?) when I added deletion.
R: Resolved. I changed the selected_vertex, edge, face fields to be explicitly null initially in mygl.

B: Seg fault on any vertex deletion.
R: Resolved. I did not create the links from vertices to edges when making the cube.

B: When deleting vertices that would remove all remaining faces in the mesh, floating vertices and edges can still be selected.
R: Resolved. I added an edge case to the end of my delete function.

B: Adding vertices causes some normals to go out of whack.
R: UNRESOLVED. This is an issue with polygons not being convex, and doing the vertex normals by vertex instead of by face.

B: Triangulating NGons that are not convex will cause wonkiness.
R: UNRESOLVED.
