HW 5 and 6: Help log by Dan McCann

Q: Question	A: Answer	

Q: Why is it so annoying to get the start point of an edge?
A: It isn't, e.sym.vert gets it if sym exists. -- Remi

Q: How do you approach constructing the buffers from half edge traversal?
A: Look at the instructions. It's done by face. -- Remi

Q: Why are the edges rainbow?
A: Use the vertex color buffers for your drawable. -- Adam

Q: How do you remove something from a vector?
A: erase(vec.start() + i) where i is the index of the element to be removed. -- Stack Overflow.

Q: How do you remove only one pointer from a vector without deleting it?
A: Don't try. Find another container or a workaround. -- Stack Overflow, Google

HW6:

Q: How do you modify several multiple things with a function?
A: References. You can pass ptr*& into a function, and changing ptr inside the function
	will also change it outside with the power of references. -- Adam

Q: How do you efficiently update the QListWidgets?
A: Deleting anything extending QListWidgetItem will automatically delete it from a list.
	You could also pass the widget pointer through functions and add things one by one instead of clearing and updating. 
	--Kai, Piazza

Q: When using a QHash with QPairs as keys, and the QPairs are created on the stack, will there be any issues?
A: No. There will be some structural test allowing it to work. -- Kai, Adam

Q: In the QFileOpenDialog example in the documentation, what is the tr() function they include?
A: A translation macro that you do not need to worry about. -- Kai

Q: Subdivision on the cube does not quite converge to a sphere but it is consistent. Is this okay?
A: This is the way we expect. See, this is how Maya does it: (shows example on Blender) -- Kai

B: Bug / Difficulty	R: Resolution

B: Making the cube creates a bad_alloc
R: Resolved. Found an incorrect edge->next pointer in the cube. A while loop never finished and it ran out of memory.

B: One corner of the cube has a gradient
R: Resolved. Checked pointers and found an incorrect edge traversal.

B: Trying to redraw the cube causes a GL_Invalid_Operation
R: Resolved. Call update() in MyGL instead of the repaint function.

B: Segmentation fault when calling the edge split function
R: Resolved. When updating the QListWidgets, clear() or erase DELETES all elements, does not remove them. 
	They must be removed one by one and added again.

B: Crash soon after edge split when OpenGL complains about timers.
R: Resolved. Passed something of the wrong type into a buffer related function.

B: Seg fault on debugger only (?) when I added deletion.
R: Resolved. I changed the selected_vertex, edge, face fields to be explicitly null initially in mygl.

B: Seg fault on any vertex deletion.
R: Resolved. I did not create the links from vertices to edges when making the cube.

B: When deleting vertices that would remove all remaining faces in the mesh, floating vertices and edges can still be selected.
R: Resolved. I added an edge case to the end of my delete function.

B: Adding vertices causes some normals to go out of whack.
R: UNRESOLVED. This is an issue with polygons not being convex, and doing the vertex normals by vertex instead of by face.

B: Triangulating NGons that are not convex will cause wonkiness.
R: UNRESOLVED.


HW6: 

B: Seg Fault when quadrangulating faces
R: Resolved. A few pointers were not being set correctly by edge division.

B: When the mesh is divided, the original faces (now smaller) become triangles. Trying to smooth again seg faults.
R: Resolved. The edge case of connecting the last new face to the original was not covered completely.

B: Seg Fault when subdividing a mesh with a hole.
R: Resolved. Added condition to edge division in case the edges pointed to null faces.

B: Seg Fault when importing a file.
R: Resolved. The file was being read properly but the faces did not have start edges, and the buffer creation crashed

B: Imported object successully displayed on the screen, but the lighting is inverted.
	The edges are counterclockwise.
R: Resolved. The cube from HW5 was constructed clockwise, and the normals had to be flipped. 
	Solved with the help of Adam, Piazza, and the next edge button.
