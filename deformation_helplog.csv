4/25/2015 17:22:13,Deformation,,"Create overlapping boxes and then a lattice to keep track of them.
(I ended up not going with this idea)",Paul
4/25/2015 17:24:38,Deformation,"Is it a full grid in the inside?
Data structure to contain the lattice? I currently am just containing the vertices without connecting them. Other ideas included halfedge (which doesn't work I assume because the middle vertices wouldn't work) and creating boxes with a lattice on top.","Yes.
Either the first or third would work.
The Half-edge idea won't work.",Adam

4/27/2015 14:48:36,Deformation,Kai Demo Please,"Kai demoed on cow, I checked my cow.
Realized my cow was wrong. Going to debug my cow.",Kai
4/27/2015 21:05:40,Deformation,What could be wrong with my cow? It extends pass the lattice.,Are you deforming on a deformed cow? You should be deforming on the mesh the same all the time.,Kai
4/27/2015 21:08:09,Deformation,Am I breaking raytracing?,No. Raytracing should be able to handle it.,Adam.

4/27/2015 21:13:10,Deformation,"Should the mesh be allowed to change as we're deforming? Because otherwise this is break deformation.

I'm deforming such that I change the actual mesh vertex and keep track of the original mesh vertex before deformation.",You can just restrict that the mesh isn't changed. ,"Paul, Adam"
